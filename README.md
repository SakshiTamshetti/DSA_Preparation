This repository is a small log of my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms.  
It exists mainly to keep me accountable, track what I am learning, and capture the problems I solve along the way.


## A note for visitors 👀

This is a personal learning repository rather than an open project.  
If you pass by and find something useful or relatable for your own preparation, that makes this space even more meaningful.
